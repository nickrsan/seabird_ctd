"""
	SeaBird CTD is meant to handle reading data from a stationary CTD logger. Many packages exist for profile loggers,
	but no options structured for use on a stationary logger or reading. This package is designed to remain directly connected
	to a CTD while it's logging and can be extended to support communication with different versions of the Seabird CTD
	loggers with different capabilities and command descriptions.
