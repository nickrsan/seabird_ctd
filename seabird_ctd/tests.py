			so that it can send without reading in those situations. This test makes sure deletion doesn't raise an exception.

			What's unfortunate is that due to the way tthe exception is raised (during a __del__ call), it doesn't actually
			propagate up. So, this test will always pass, but is here so that should an exception occur during object
			deletion, it points back to this test.
